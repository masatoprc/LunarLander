# LunarLander
In an edit panel, you can drag terrain points up and down, and position a landing pad by dragging or double-clicking. 
Undo is supported for all edits. 
In the play panel, you use WASD to guide the lunar lander to the landing pad without hitting the terrain or going out of bounds. 
You have to land on the pad slowly. 
The lunar lander is always centred in the window while playing.
